This Javascript bookmarklet works when you are
reading user comments for a thread. It adds 3
"buttons" on the lower right corner of the
window: reload, byParent and byReply.

"reload" reloads the page and shows you 
the new comments (marked by a blue line
on top of the comment).

byParent & byReply sorts the comments newest
to oldest. byParent sorts by the replies to
the article. byReply sorts by replies to
other comments. (Its a little confusing --
I know!)
